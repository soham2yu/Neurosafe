You are a senior frontend engineer.

Create a React frontend using Vite for a product called "NeuroSafe AI".
This is a DEMO MVP. No real authentication. No backend changes.

TECH STACK:
- React + Vite
- React Router DOM
- Plain CSS or minimal inline styles
- Fetch API (no axios)
- Environment variable for backend URL

BACKEND:
Base URL comes from environment variable:
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://neurosafe-backend.onrender.com

API:
POST /analyze
Request body:
{
  "text": string,
  "environment": string
}

REQUIREMENTS:

1. ROUTES
- "/"        → Landing page (product explanation + CTA)
- "/login"   → Fake login (name + role select)
- "/dashboard" → User dashboard
- "/analyze" → Risk analysis page

2. FAKE AUTH
- On login, store user in localStorage as "neurosafe_user"
- User object: { name, role }
- No passwords
- If no user, redirect to /login
- Protect /dashboard and /analyze routes

3. LANDING PAGE
- Title: NeuroSafe AI
- Subtitle: Decision-safety assistant for high-risk digital agreements
- One short example scenario
- Button: "Try Demo" → /login

4. LOGIN PAGE
- Input: Name
- Select: Role (Student, Freelancer, Founder)
- Button: Continue
- On submit, save user to localStorage and redirect to /dashboard

5. DASHBOARD
- Welcome message with user name
- Button: "Analyze New Agreement"
- List of previous analyses from localStorage (if any)
- Each analysis shows date + risk level

6. ANALYZE PAGE
- Textarea to paste agreement
- Dropdown: Environment (Calm, Stressed, Overwhelmed)
- Disable analyze button until text length > 50
- Show loading state while calling backend
- POST to /analyze using fetch
- Save result to localStorage history
- Display result clearly:
  - Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)
  - Bullet list of key risks
  - Short warning message

7. UX RULES
- Clear loading indicators
- Clear error handling
- No console errors
- Clean component separation
- No giant files

8. FILE STRUCTURE
/src
  /pages
    Landing.jsx
    Login.jsx
    Dashboard.jsx
    Analyze.jsx
  /components
    ProtectedRoute.jsx
  App.jsx
  main.jsx

OUTPUT:
- Working React app
- Ready to run on Replit
- Professional, demo-ready UI
